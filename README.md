# wink_city

A new Flutter package. This is an app that allows people who are nearby to connect by scanning the area for other users who are currently also scanning. This project creates an app that requires the user to sign in. it then connects to a firestore database which marks the users preferences. When the scan button is pressed the geolocation will be used to search the database for other online users (that match the preferences).
